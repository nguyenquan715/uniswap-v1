### Description

This project aims to reimplement the Uniswap V1 smart contract. The goal is to understand and replicate the functionality of Uniswap V1 by developing a smart contract from scratch, thereby gaining deep insights into decentralized exchange mechanisms and automated market maker (AMM).

### Objectives

1. Understand the Uniswap V1 Protocol: Study the original Uniswap V1 smart contracts and associated documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the protocol's structure and functionalities.
2. Design and Implement the Smart Contract: Develop the Uniswap V1 smart contract from scratch, replicating the core functionalities of the original protocol.
